# SAI (Software AI)
## Human Driven, helped, designed, and supported by AI

First announce: 20250401

## Overview
SAI is a solution designed to handle various software-related use cases across different environments. It simplifies tasks such as installing, managing, configuring, monitoring, testing, debugging, and troubleshooting software on platforms like Linux (RedHat, Debian, Suse, Arch, etc.), Windows, macOS, containers, and Kubernetes.

## Synopsis
```
sai <action> <software> [provider]
```

### Parameters
1. **`<action>`**: The operation to perform on the software.
   - Supported Actions:
     - `install`, `test`, `build`, `log`, `check`, `observe`, `trace`, `config`

2. **`<software>`**: The name of the software to manage.
   - Examples: `nginx`, `docker`, `helm`, `mysql`, `redis`

3. **`[provider]`** (optional): The specific implementation or package manager for the environment.
   - Examples: `rpm`, `apt`, `brew`, `winget`, `helm`, `kubectl`

## Examples
1. Install nginx using brew:
   ```
   sai install nginx brew
   ```

2. Test  container:
   ```
   sai test docker
   ```

3. Build a Helm chart:
   ```
   sai build mychart helm
   ```

4. Retrieve logs for nginx:
   ```
   sai log nginx
   ```

5. Check the status of MySQL:
   ```
   sai check mysql
   ```

6. Monitor Redis performance:
   ```
   sai observe redis
   ```

7. Trace an application using kubectl:
   ```
   sai trace myapp kubectl
   ```

8. Configure nginx settings:
   ```
   sai config nginx
   ```

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across Linux, macOS, Windows, and containerized environments.
- **Provider Abstraction**: Handles provider-specific commands internally for simplicity.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new actions, software, and providers.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages for unsupported actions, software, or providers.
